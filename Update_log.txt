Updates log v0.3

Log 4/8: Code is cleaned up significantly from intial release.  Many comments have been added to help identify code blocks.  
Many varribles have been changed to easier names (i.e. self.Cog1 to self.cog_1, self.textob1 to self.cogtag_1, etc.)
Animation blending has been added, and many lines of redundent code have been remove.  Updates coming soon, with release of
v0.3 coming soon.

Log 4/12| 4/13:  Added significant updates to main.py.  Several functions to control the big cheese's hat, color of hands, and scale have been added.  There is now the ability to close the Info tab in the top left corner of the app, and key binds have been added, such as Esc for closing the program, and M for stoping the music.  After the functions, I cleaned up the code significantly by re-wording comments, updating some grammar problems in the application gui, fixed indentation problems, spacing, etc.  v0.3 is pretty much done, and will probably be the last alpha release.  More hats, colors, and a *new* texture button that changes cog_1's textures will be added in the offical pre-release of v1.0

Log 4/14: main.py has been cleaned up again.  Many lines like frameColor on the buttons were removed since they were not needed.  Also, the program now opens in 1920 x 1080, and an exit button has been added.  In the next update, v1.0 pre-release, cog textures will be changeable.
