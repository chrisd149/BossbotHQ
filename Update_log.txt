Updates log 

Log 4/8: Code is cleaned up significantly from intial release.  Many comments have been added to help identify code blocks.  
Many varribles have been changed to easier names (i.e. self.Cog1 to self.cog_1, self.textob1 to self.cogtag_1, etc.)
Animation blending has been added, and many lines of redundent code have been remove.  Updates coming soon, with release of
v0.3 coming soon.

Log 4/12| 4/13:  Added significant updates to main.py.  Several functions to control the big cheese's hat, color of hands, and scale have been added. 
There is now the ability to close the Info tab in the top left corner of the app, and key binds have been added, such as Esc for closing the program, and M for stoping the music.  
After the functions, I cleaned up the code significantly by re-wording comments, updating some grammar problems in the application gui, fixed indentation problems, spacing, etc.  
v0.3 is pretty much done, and will probably be the last alpha release.  More hats, colors, and a *new* texture button that changes cog_1's textures will be added in the offical pre-release of v1.0

Log 4/14: main.py has been cleaned up again.  Many lines like frameColor on the buttons were removed since they were not needed.  
Also, the program now opens in 1920 x 1080, and an exit button has been added.  In the next update, v1.0 pre-release, cog textures will be changeable.

Log 4/15 - 4/18: Added a button to change textures, updated the exit pop up to be more understandable and exitable in itself.  
main.py will be replaced by main.cpython-37.pyc as the main file to install soon, since it directly opens the app without an IDE.

Log 4/18 | 4/19: Changed all buttons' names to be more understandable, and updated exit pop-up to look better.  

Log 4/26 - 4/28:  main.cpython.37.pyc is deleted, since main.py could be open with the default python IDE.  A wiki button has been added above the exit button, that opens the Cog Training wiki. 

class AppInfo in main.py now creates a game log file that writes the runtime of main.py, and notes whether it is normal or slower than normal.  
AppInfo also displays data of main.py, such as runtime, authors, and version # in the python terminal.

Log 5/16/19: main.py has been updated to have better function/varriable names, and comments have been updated to be more clearer. 
Most of the code has been changed to follow conventional naming schematics for Python.

Log 5/25/19: There is several new content updates for main.py.  More glove colors and accessories have been added, and new large scale option as been added.  Code has been changed in main.py, with more typo cleanup and proper indentation.  I have access to a Mac computer now, and will test the program on it.
