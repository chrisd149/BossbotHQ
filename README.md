<h1>Cog Training</h1>

This is a early project for a very basic User Interactive game using Panda3D and Python.  


**NOTE:** this is my first "real" programming project, and as such code may not be clearly readable and buggy

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<h3>System Info</h3>	

*	**OS**: Windows 10/8/7/Vista/XP, not tested on Unix/Linux or MacOS.

*	**CPU**: 500Mhz< CPU, 1Ghz< Recommended

*	**GPU**: CPU interal graphics, any Nividia or Radeon GPU recommended

*	**Memory**: 200mb<, 512mb< recommended

<h3>Software Info</h3>

*	**Engine**: ***Panda3D-1.10***

*	**Programming Language**: ***Python 3.7***

*	**Language**: English, Spanish and possibly others later.

<h2>Installing</h2>

First off, the program is ran in Python only.  You can download the main project file, or copy its contents into a Python script.

To install
	
	1.	Download files from the latest release from the releases section.
	2.	Install Panda3D-1.10-02 if not already installed, at www.panda3d.org/download
	3.      Go to www.toontownrewritten.com/play, and install Toontown Rewritten.
	4.      Go to the Toontown Rewritten Folder, and copy/paste the .mf phase files into your Panda3D folder. 
	5.	Open main.py in your choice of Python IDE (e.g. PyCharm, Atom, etc).
	4.	Run main.py, it will open up in a Panda3D enviroment window, similar to Toontown.
	
<h2>Built With</h2>

*	[***Panda3D***](https://www.panda3d.org/) - Game engine used and tutorials.

*	[***Toontown Rewritten***](https://www.toontownrewritten.com/) - Phase files imported from Toontown phase files.

*	[***PyCharm***](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) - IDE used to build program.

<h2>Goals of Project</h2>

<h3>Main Goals</h3>

*	[X] **Sequences of animations of multiple actors**

*	[X] **GUI buttons with working animations/sounds**

*  	[X] **Advanced functions that change colors, scale, load/delete models, and textures**

*	[ ] **Have the program run as an .exe file**
