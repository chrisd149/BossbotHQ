<h6>v1.0 Beta Main GUI</h6>

This is a early project for a very basic User Interactive game using Panda3D and Python.  


**NOTE:** this is my first "real" programming project, and as such code may not be clearly readable and buggy

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<h3>System Info</h3>	

*	**OS**: Windows 10/8/7/Vista/XP

*	**CPU**: 500Mhz< CPU, 1Ghz< Recommended

*	**Memory**: 200mb<, 512mb< recommended

<h3>Software Info</h3>

*	**Engine**: ***Panda3D-1.10***

*	**Programming Language**: ***Python 3.7***

*	**Language**: English, Spanish possibly later.

<h2>Installing</h2>

To install
	
	1.	Download files from the latest release from the releases section.
	2.	Install Panda3D-1.10-02 if not already installed, at www.panda3d.org/download
	3.      Go to www.toontownrewritten.com/play, and install Toontown Rewritten.
	4.      Go to the Toontown Rewritten Folder, and copy/paste the .mf phase files into your Panda3D folder 
		(For this project, only phase_3 through phase_5.5, and phase_9 through phase_11 files are needed). 
	5.	Open main.cpython-37.pyc to run the application (It will open the command prompt to start).
