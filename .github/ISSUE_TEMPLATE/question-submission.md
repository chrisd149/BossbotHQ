**Is your question to the authors are to anyone?**
If addressed to authors, all replies by non-authors will be auto removed. Ex. Authors; Anyone

**What is your question?**
Keep your question somewhat formal, using normal writing conventions.  Stray away from ranting. Ex. When will there be an upgrade to Python 3.8?; What is the estimated ETA for the next update?

**Additional Context**
Provide more context to your question, such as your reasoning for your question. Ex. Since Python 3.8 is officially releasing later this year, implementing Python 3.8 early could fix bugs before a majority of users switch to it
